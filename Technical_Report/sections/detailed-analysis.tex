\chapter{Detailed Analysis}

\section{Identification of Implicated Individuals}
The digital forensic investigation has identified Ken Warren as a potentially implicated individual. Metadata analysis has shown that Ken Warren was the last author of multiple documents that are linked to illegal activities. Notably, the document labelled "Passwords and stuff.docx" lists Ken Warren as the last author. This document, among others, was found within the user account directories associated with the alias 'Frodo,' indicating that Ken Warren may be operating under this pseudonym.

In parallel, the investigation has brought attention to another individual, Mike, whose digital footprint has surfaced in the examination of key documents. Mike is listed as the owner of "Basic Donuts.doc," a file containing one of the proprietary recipes. He is also the owner of "Dad.xlsx," which contained an embedded message leading to the 'honey duff doughnut' recipe. The correlation of these files with Mike's user account underscores his potential involvement with the unauthorized handling of sensitive information.

The repeated presence of Ken Warren's authorship in critical files, particularly those within Frodo's account, raises suspicion and suggests a deliberate attempt to conceal his identity behind an alias. The analysis of Mike's files, containing crucial recipe information, aligns with the narrative of information exfiltration.

The metadata extracted from these files has provided a thread connecting both Ken Warren and Mike to the case at hand.

\subsection{Geolocation Data Analysis}
Geolocation data analysis involves the examination of digital artefacts to extract geographical coordinates or location markers that could provide insights into the movements or intended movements of individuals under investigation. However, in the context of this case, the forensic analysis using Autopsy has not yielded geolocation data from the expected sources, such as image metadata typically found in the EXIF headers.

\textbf{Introduction to the Issue:}\\
During the digital forensic examination of the suspect's files, it was observed that potential sources of geolocation data, such as photographs and documents, appear to have been deliberately stripped of EXIF metadata which would've contained rich information, including the time a photo was taken and the geographical coordinates of the location. The absence of such data is indicative of a conscious effort to remove traces that could reveal the suspect's locations or travel patterns.

\textbf{Implications of EXIF Data Scrubbing:}\\
The lack of geolocation data presents several implications for the investigation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Intentional Obfuscation:} The deliberate scrubbing of EXIF data suggests a high level of sophistication and awareness by the suspect. This act of obfuscation can be interpreted as an attempt to avoid detection or to complicate the investigative process.
    \item \textbf{Potential Precautionary Measures:} The suspect may have employed precautionary measures to prevent geolocation tracking, which could be consistent with actions taken to conceal illicit activities.
    \item \textbf{Alternative Investigative Avenues:} The absence of direct geolocation data necessitates the exploration of alternative avenues for gathering location-based evidence. This could include analysis of network logs, travel documents, and communication metadata.
\end{itemize}

The absence of EXIF geolocation data does not preclude the presence of other forms of digital evidence that could inform the suspect's location history or travel plans. Further technical examination of the digital artefacts, coupled with a broader contextual analysis of the suspect's known associates and behaviours, may yield supplementary information that can compensate for the lack of direct geolocation evidence.

\section{Examination of User Accounts}
Examination of user accounts forms a key stage of the forensic investigation, addressing one of the key goals of the forensic report: identifying all user accounts on Taurus Smith's laptop, understanding the methods of their concealment, and detailing the recovery process. This section draws upon findings detailed in the references section and leverages information discussed in "3.4.3. User Account Identification and Recovery Techniques."

\subsection{Methods of Concealment}
Analysis suggests the use of several methods to conceal user accounts on Taurus Smith's laptop:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Account Names as a Distraction:} The use of familiar literary names for user accounts (e.g., "Bilbo Baggins," "Frodo Baggins," "Sam") could be a deliberate tactic to mislead or minimize suspicion regarding the account's purpose.
    \item \textbf{Unused Profile Directories:} The presence of an account named "New folder" with no associated files or activity may indicate an attempt to either hide the account post-use or set it up in anticipation of future use without drawing attention.
    \item \textbf{Accounts with Minimal Footprint:} The "Penelope Olsen" account, which lacks a corresponding user profile or document directory, suggests an effort to create an account with a minimal digital footprint, potentially for covert activities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recovery and Analysis of User Profiles}
The process of recovering and analysing user profiles involved a meticulous review of the system's registry files, particularly the SAM and SECURITY hives, as well as system logs and file ownership data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Forensic Software:} Utilization of forensic software allowed for the recovery of user profile information even when attempts had been made to delete or obscure such profiles.
    \item \textbf{Registry Examination:} An in-depth analysis of the SAM hive revealed the creation times and last login dates associated with the user accounts, providing a timeline of account activity. These findings are crucial in establishing when these accounts were active and potentially linked to unauthorized activities.
    \item \textbf{Correlation with Other Evidence:} The review of login events and document access patterns provided further insight into the usage of these accounts. The cross-referencing of this information with other evidence collected (e.g., network logs, and communication intercepts) helped to piece together a more complete picture of each account's role in the suspect's activities.
\end{itemize}

The recovery and analysis of these user profiles have been instrumental in progressing toward answering the pivotal question of whether all user accounts on Taurus Smith's laptop have been identified and how they were concealed. The technical report will continue to be updated with these findings, emphasizing the importance of this goal in the overall context of the forensic investigation. Further details regarding the analysis process and the techniques employed can be found in the references section, providing transparency, and allowing for the reproducibility of the results.


The technical analysis and message content, when combined with the known network identifiers (IP and MAC addresses) and the contextual backdrop of Taurus Smith's alleged activities, provide substantial insights into the methods used for the suspected unauthorized data transfer. This evidence could be critical in forming the narrative of how Taurus Smith may have conducted the alleged corporate espionage.
