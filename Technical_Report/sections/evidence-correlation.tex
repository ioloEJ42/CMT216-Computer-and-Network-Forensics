\chapter{Evidence Correlation}

\section{Cross-Source Evidence Integration}
Digital evidence from filesystem artifacts, network captures, registry analysis, and cryptographic examination was integrated to establish a comprehensive picture of the case. All evidence timestamps were normalized to UTC, revealing concentrated activity between January-March 2010, with peak activity in early March 2010.

\section{Implicated Individuals} 
\subsection{Ken Warren/Frodo Connection}
Multiple evidence sources conclusively link Ken Warren to the "Frodo Baggins" user account:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Document metadata identifies Ken Warren as author of 7 files in "Frodo Baggins" directory
    \item System hostname "FRODO1" in Windows registry correlates with user account naming
    \item Ken Warren identified as owner in metadata of three encrypted files:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "Lard Land Super Donuts Instructions.pdf" (password: cm3111)
        \item "Retire Scenario Adjustable for Tax Inflation.xls" (password: secret)
        \item "Mortgage accounting inc escrow.xls" (password: hobbit05)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Password "hobbit05" matches "Lord of the Rings" themed account naming pattern
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mike's Role}
Evidence implicating "Mike" includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item File ownership metadata identifying Mike as owner of "Basic Donuts.doc"
    \item Mike's ownership of "Dad.xlsx" containing critical clue: "The secret lies in the Special Pink Donut"
    \item Timeline correlation between Mike's files and steganographic activities
\end{itemize}

\section{Travel Evidence Integration}
Three independent evidence sources confirm Hawaii as Taurus Smith's destination:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Flight plan image (f0066494.png) recovered from unallocated space showing Cardiff-Hawaii route
    \item Network message "see you in hawaii!" in Exhibit E packet capture
    \item Registry searches for "cardiff donut" establishing starting location
    \item Chronological sequence placing travel planning after recipe transmission
\end{itemize}

Evidence of deliberate anti-forensic techniques includes systematic EXIF metadata removal from images and ExifTool software installation (January 2, 2010) preceding image creation dates.

\section{Recipe Concealment Techniques}
Multiple complementary techniques were employed to hide proprietary recipes:

\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{6cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Technique} & \textbf{Implementation} & \textbf{Evidence Sources} \\
\hline
Primary Steganography & Online tool embedding in bean.png and coconuts.png & Email artifact, network traffic, image analysis \\
\hline
Secondary Steganography & Stegoshare with "donut" password in pink donut image & Special Pink Donut image, dad.xls hint \\
\hline
Encryption & Themed passwords: "cm3111", "ring", "hobbit05" & Successfully decrypted files, metadata \\
\hline
Directory Misdirection & Recipe files in photo directories & Filesystem structure analysis \\
\hline
Deletion & Recipe found in unallocated space & File carving recovery \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

Technical proficiency indicators include practice steganography files (Shakespeare text in zebra.bmp), S-Tools optimization, and the network message: "using different way, some of them are steged".

\section{Integrated Timeline of Activities}
Evidence correlation reveals a sophisticated operational sequence:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Preparation} (January 2010): Steganography software installation, EXIF tools deployment, multiple user account creation
    \item \textbf{Capability Development} (January-February): Steganography practice with Shakespeare text, multiple encryption methods testing
    \item \textbf{Collection} (February-March): Recipe acquisition, document preparation 
    \item \textbf{Concealment} (Early March): Steganographic embedding, encryption, directory obfuscation
    \item \textbf{Exfiltration} (March): Network transmission using non-standard port 1234 to VMware virtual machine
    \item \textbf{Evasion Planning} (March): Hawaii travel arrangements, file deletion, trace removal
\end{enumerate}

Technical sophistication indicators across all evidence sources include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item VMware virtualization for recipient anonymity
    \item Multiple steganography techniques with different tools 
    \item "Lord of the Rings" themed account naming and password strategy
    \item Strategic registry manipulation and command-line cleanup operations
    \item EXIF geolocation data removal while preserving other metadata
\end{itemize}

This coordinated pattern of activities, supported by multiple independent evidence sources, demonstrates a deliberate corporate espionage operation involving Taurus Smith, Ken Warren, and Mike, with specialized roles in the acquisition, processing, and exfiltration of Lard\&land Donuts' proprietary recipe information.
