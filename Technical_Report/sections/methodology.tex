\chapter{Methodology}

\section{Forensic Investigation Framework}
This investigation follows the ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers) Guidelines for Digital Evidence, complemented by NIST SP 800-86 recommendations for computer forensic examinations. This integrated framework ensures both procedural validity and scientific rigor, addressing the unique challenges presented by multi-source digital evidence analysis in potential corporate espionage cases.

\section{Evidence Acquisition and Preservation}

\subsection{Digital Evidence Handling Protocol}
The acquisition phase commenced with strict adherence to forensic best practices for physical and digital evidence handling. The USB storage device containing the laptop image was processed in a controlled environment with electrostatic discharge protection measures in place. All evidence handling occurred in a designated forensic workstation isolated from network connectivity to prevent cross-contamination or inadvertent modification of evidentiary data.

To maintain evidential integrity, the following protocols were implemented:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Environmental controls including temperature and humidity monitoring
    \item Use of anti-static workstations and grounding equipment
    \item Photographic documentation of physical media condition prior to processing
    \item Isolation from electromagnetic interference sources
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Forensic Imaging Methodology}
The forensic imaging process employed multiple validation techniques to ensure data fidelity. The examination utilized a Tableau T35u write-blocker configured with USB 3.0 connectivity to create an acquisition environment where source media remained unaltered throughout the process. AccessData FTK Imager (version 4.5.0.3) was employed to create an E01 format forensic image, utilizing the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compression: 4 (optimal balance between size and processing time)
    \item Sector count verification during image creation
    \item Configurable read retries for damaged sectors: 5 attempts
    \item Evidence file segmentation: 2GB (optimized for storage and verification)
\end{itemize}

Contemporaneous documentation was maintained throughout the acquisition process, recording start and end times, any anomalies encountered, and system configuration parameters.

\subsection{Digital Evidence Authentication}
Authentication of the acquired evidence employed a multi-hash verification methodology. The following cryptographic hash algorithms were applied to the evidentiary data:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{8cm}|p{3cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Hash Algorithm} & \textbf{Hash Value} & \textbf{Verification Status} \\
\hline
MD5 & \raggedright 56aeba1a708c5210c8728e5a2560f9ca  & Verified \\
\hline
SHA-1 & \raggedright 3b023acd0e09d7db8bf5d1df725135a5f3bfc481 & Verified \\
\hline
SHA-256 & \raggedright a2f49fa7ce6b111c6e198de2ca4a24a8e73d6d85\\291805db5bede4d60fab23be  & Verified \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Hash Verification Results}
\label{tab:hash_verification}
\end{table}

Multiple hash algorithms provide enhanced authentication assurance, as the probability of hash collisions across different algorithms approaches zero, thereby ensuring that the evidentiary image remains unaltered throughout the analytical process.

\end{table}

This modular approach allowed for targeted analysis of specific evidentiary aspects while maintaining a cohesive investigative framework. The implementation followed a logical progression from file system integrity verification to specialized content analysis.

\subsection{Resource-Optimized Analysis Approach}
Due to computational resource constraints typical in academic and resource-limited forensic environments, a selective, focused analytical approach was implemented:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Targeted Timeline Analysis}: Rather than processing the entire evidence corpus with computationally intensive timeline analysis, a selective approach was employed focusing on high-value directories including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User profile directories
        \item Document repositories
        \item System and application logs
        \item Communication artifacts
        \item Recently accessed files
    \end{itemize}
    This approach delivered analytical depth in critical areas while optimizing processing resources.
    
    \item \textbf{Progressive Processing Methodology}: Analysis modules were executed in a staged approach, with each stage informing the focus areas for subsequent analyses. This iterative methodology established a feedback loop where initial findings guided deeper analysis in specific areas of evidential significance.
\end{itemize}
