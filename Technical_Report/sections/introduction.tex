\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose and Scope of the Investigation}
This investigation aims to conduct a thorough forensic analysis of digital evidence associated with the suspect, Taurus Smith, alias Mrs. Mona Simpson. The inquiry aims to uncover any digital traces that support the suspicion of illegal activity, specifically the potential leakage of proprietary recipes from Lard\&land Donuts to a competitor. The scope encompasses the examination of a USB flash drive image and any recoverable data from a liquid-damaged mobile phone (Exhibit A), while also considering network activity that may link Taurus Smith to her accomplice(s) and outline her travel intentions.

\section{Background of the Case}
Taurus Smith, an employee at Lard\&land Donuts, is suspected of being a secret agent for their competitor, Diggity Doughnuts, and having unauthorised access to the company's secret recipe for 'Honey Duff Donuts'. An incident involving an unrecognized laptop connecting to the company's wireless network, followed by instant message exchanges with Taurus Smith's computer, raised suspicions of a computer misuse attack. This led to the involvement of local police, who found a USB stick and a liquid-damaged mobile phone at the last known address of the alias, Mrs Mona Simpson.

\section{Overview of Methodology}
The methodology adheres to digital forensics' best practices and the methodology covered in the CM3111 Forensics coursework. It includes secure evidence acquisition, integrity verification, thorough examination using forensic tools like Autopsy, and detailed analysis of findings. Special attention is given to uncovering deleted, hidden, or obfuscated data, user account analysis, network traffic examination, and correlating findings with the case's context.

\section{Objectives and Key Questions}
The investigation is guided by the following key questions, which aim to unravel the details of the suspected illicit activities:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is there anyone else implicated? If so, who? Show any evidence sup-porting your findings
    \item What were Taurus Smith’s travel plans, and do they have any relevance to the alleged illegal activity?
    \item Can all user accounts on Taurus Smith’s laptop be identified, and what methods were used to conceal them?
    \item Analyse hidden recipes on the laptop, and what techniques were employed to obscurethem.
    \item What does the analysis of network activity reveal about the incident, and can it provide a detailed evidence trail?
\end{enumerate}

The outcomes of this investigation will significantly contribute to the understanding of the case and provide a basis for legal proceedings if necessary. The findings will be meticulously documented in a technical report and a separate court report to ensure clarity and legal admissibility.
