\section{Description and Condition of the Physical Evidence}
The physical evidence pertinent to this case includes a USB flash drive and a liquid-damaged mobile phone, both retrieved from Taurus Smith's last known address. Although the mobile phone exhibits signs of liquid damage which may hinder data extraction efforts, it should still be subjected to an attempt at data recovery. The USB flash drive, crucial to the investigation, was found to contain an image of a laptop hard drive. This image is presumed to hold vital information that could potentially answer the key investigative questions.

\section{Imaging and Preservation of Digital Evidence}
Given that direct access to the USB flash drive was not possible and only an image of its contents is available, the focus will be on preserving the integrity of this image. The imaging process for the mobile phone, if feasible, must also be documented, even if it was conducted by another party before receipt.

\textbf{Secure Storage of USB Flash Drive Image:} The image of the USB flash drive has been stored on a secure, write-protected medium. This measure prevents any alterations to the data, maintaining its original state as found during the seizure. The write protection ensures that the integrity of the evidence is preserved, a critical aspect of any digital forensic investigation.

\textbf{Secure and Controlled Access to Digital Evidence:} All digital evidence has been stored in a secure, access-controlled environment. Access to this evidence is exclusively controlled by me, ensuring that there is no unauthorized access or tampering. This controlled environment is crucial for maintaining the chain of custody and the overall integrity of the evidence, which is paramount in forensic investigations.

\section{Integrity Verification and Documentation}
The integrity of the digital evidence is paramount. Without the original MD5 hash values provided before imaging, the forensic process's integrity relies on the consistency of the evidence throughout its lifecycle from acquisition to analysis.
